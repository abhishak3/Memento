This is a simple Task Management Application implemented using [Technology Stack - List your technology stack here]. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks.
> NOTE: Please wait for around (1 minute) for loading. The initial startup of the application takes time as I'm on the free tier. Till then have fun with loading animation :)
